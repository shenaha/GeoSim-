# Geosimulation Modelling WS 2017/2018 Assignment

Using Netlogo we did few changes in the already existing Segregation Model , to get new results.
This project models the behavior of two types of agents in a neighborhood. The red agents and green agents get along with one another. 
But each agent wants to make sure that it lives near some of "its own‚Äù. That is, each red agent wants to live near at least some red agents, and each green agent wants to live near at least some green agents. 
The simulation shows how these individual preferences ripple through the neighborhood, leading to large-scale patterns
